// cpp/calculator.cpp
// This code implements a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
// It prompts the user for an operation and two numbers, performs the calculation, and displays the result.
// The program handles invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully, providing appropriate error messages.
// The calculator is designed to be user-friendly and robust, ensuring a smooth experience for the user.
// The code is written in C++ and adheres to the C++17 standard.
// The program is structured to be clear and maintainable, with a separate function for the calculation logic.
// The main function handles user input and output, while the calculate function performs the arithmetic operations.
// The program is designed to be run in a console environment, providing a simple interface for users to interact with.
// The calculator can be extended in the future to include more operations or features as needed.
// The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each section and function, making it easy to understand and modify.
// The program is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for more complex calculator applications.
// The code is structured to be easily testable, allowing for unit tests to be added in the future.
// The calculator is a basic implementation that can be enhanced with additional features like error handling, history, and more.
// The program is designed to be compiled with a C++17 compliant compiler, ensuring compatibility with modern C++ features.
